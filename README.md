### Bio

👤 I am a 2nd year Information Technology student @ ASU. I have always been in love with tech from a young age and fiddled with programming on and off throughout my middle and highschool days.

🪄 I hold a deep interest in the client-side of web development. The eternal pursuit of what's possible within creative design / UI and the constant tango of how to translate these designs effectively to the programming side to bring a functional, accessible, and expressive experience to users.

💟 Outside of web development and designing, I enjoy a plethora of passions and hobbies but you'll mostly find me: 
- 🏀 Playing basketball
- 🎧 Listening to music (latest song: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKEwnhc8ItY">Cash In, Cash Out - Pharrell Williams ft. Tyler, the Creator & 21 Savage</a>)
- 📖 Reading books (latest read: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299">Atomic Habits - James Clear</a>)
- 💬 Learning languages, I'm an aspiring polyglot! My current languages are: English (Native), Spanish (Business Proficient), while my target languages are: Korean (my favorite language!), Italian, German, Mandarin, and Swedish. 
- 🎨 Linux <a href="https://jie-fang.github.io/blog/basics-of-ricing">Ricing</a> (my latest hobby), tl;dr: I like pretty desktops! :D
- 🚀 Dipping my toe into Web3 over at <a href="https://buildspace.so/@dje">Buildspace</a>
